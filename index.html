      <h3>Loop's Magic</h3>
      <p>
        The straight-forward definition of Loop is a Hi-Tech academy. Its
        purpose is to expose the next generations (called Loopers) to the world
        of computer science and technology and offer them a personalized
        fun-based educational method according to each student's preferences and
        ambitions in a well-structured and modular customized approach. Also,
        since it is a long-term program, Loop is built to guide the Loopers
        through the years. The mentorship aspect of it promotes the idea of a
        lifelong and ongoing system in which participants later may become
        mentors and contribute to the community and even become Loop partners,
        thereby completing the loop of knowledge. â€‹
